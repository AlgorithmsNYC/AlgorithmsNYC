# Prim's Algorith

## Goal

Your goal is to implement Prim's algoritm in your favorite language for a sample graph.

### Sample graphs

Adjecency matrix

    [[0,1,4,0,0],
     [1,0,2,6,0],
     [4,2,0,3,1],
     [0,6,3,0,0],
     [0,0,1,0,0]]

## Description

Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted undirected graph.
