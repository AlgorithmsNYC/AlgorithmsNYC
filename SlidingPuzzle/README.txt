Your mission, if you accept it, is to implement the
Solver.solveBoard(Board) method, returning a Solution.
The Solution will simply be an ordered array of moves,
each move representing a piece and the next state it is moved to;

If you are really good, the Solution will represent the shortest
possible number of moves.

I have put my solution (which is far from optimal) in the com.oti.solutions.eb package.
Create your own solutions package, and put your solver in it.  In
this way we can all contribute a solution.
