// Square implies column distance equals row distance

maxSize=1 // first value is a square of size 1 by definition
foreach row
  find two equal numbers
   Calculate the distance between the two columns
    Verify that the same numbers exist at [row + distance] for both columns
     maxSize = max(maxSize, distance^2)
